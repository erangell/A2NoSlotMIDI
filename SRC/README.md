# A2NoSlotMIDI - latest Xcode source code

Build using this pipeline: https://github.com/jeremysrand/Apple2BuildPipeline

This source produces a disk image with the No Slot MIDI driver program: MIDIDRVR.OBJ

The resulting binary file is then copied to a copy of the ANN0TEST.DSK image to create the disk image for the DSK directory. 

See the ISSUES section for enhancements to be made to this code.
